This report delves into the various applications of AI in retail, highlighting key innovations and their impacts on the industry.

## AI-Driven Personalization

AI technologies enable retailers to offer personalized shopping experiences to customers by analyzing their preferences, purchase history, and browsing behavior. This level of personalization increases customer satisfaction and loyalty, driving sales growth.
