# Combining Approaches in Advanced Reporting

Combining different prompt engineering techniques can significantly enhance the quality and comprehensiveness of generated reports. By integrating multi-hop prompting, recursive strategies, graph structures, and advanced logic and reasoning, Agentic Reports can tackle complex topics with precision and depth.

## Example: The Future of AI in Smart Cities

Generating a report on "The future of AI in smart cities" might involve:

- **Multi-hop prompting** to break down the topic into subqueries like AI in traffic management, AI in energy efficiency, and AI in public safety.
- **Recursive prompting** to iteratively refine these subqueries based on initial findings.
- **Graph structures** to map out the relationships between different AI applications and their impacts on smart city development.
- **Advanced logic and reasoning** to critically analyze the data and provide well-rounded insights and projections.

### JSON Example for Combining Approaches

```json
{
  "query": "The future of AI in smart cities",
  "primary_prompt": "Generate a detailed report on the future of AI in smart cities, focusing on applications such as traffic management, energy efficiency, and public safety. The report should include an analysis of current technologies, ongoing projects, challenges, and future prospects.",
  "subqueries_prompt": "Generate 2 interesting, diverse search queries that would be useful for generating a detailed report on the future of AI in smart cities. These subqueries should cover various aspects of the topic, including current technologies, ongoing projects, challenges, and future prospects.",
  "report_prompt": "Write a comprehensive and professional in English, five-paragraph, 200-word research report about the future of AI in smart cities based on the provided information. Include citations in the text using footnote notation ([citation #]), for example [2]. First provide the report, followed by a single `References` section that only lists the URLs (and their published date) used, in the format [#] <url>. For the published date, only include the month and year. Reset the citations index and ignore the order of citations in the provided information.",
  "start_published_date": "2024-01-01",
  "end_published_date": "2024-06-03",
  "highlights": {
