# Graph Structures in Advanced Reporting

Graph Structures in advanced reporting leverage the power of graph theory to map out and analyze the relationships between various pieces of information. This technique is particularly useful for exploring complex topics where understanding the interconnections between data points can provide deeper insights.

## Example: AI in Financial Markets

In the context of "AI in financial markets," graph structures can be employed to visualize and analyze the intricate relationships between AI technologies, market trends, regulatory impacts, and economic outcomes. This approach allows for a comprehensive analysis of how AI influences different aspects of financial markets.

### JSON Example for Graph Structures

```json
{
  "query": "AI in financial markets",
  "primary_prompt": "Generate a detailed report on the current advancements, performance, and market trends of AI in financial markets. The report should include an analysis of AI technologies, market trends, regulatory impacts, and economic outcomes.",
  "subqueries_prompt": "Generate 2 interesting, diverse search queries that would be useful for generating a detailed report on AI in financial markets. These subqueries should cover various aspects of the topic, including AI technologies, market trends, regulatory impacts, and economic outcomes.",
  "report_prompt": "Write a comprehensive and professional in English, five-paragraph, 200-word research report about AI in financial markets based on the provided information. Include citations in the text using footnote notation ([citation #]), for example [2]. First provide the report, followed by a single `References` section that only lists the URLs (and their published date) used, in the format [#] <url>. For the published date, only include the month and year. Reset the citations index and ignore the order of citations in the provided information.",
  "start_published_date": "2024-01-01",
  "end_published_date": "2024-06-03",
  "highlights": {
    "num_sentences": 5
  },
  "text": {
    "include_html_tags": false
  },
  "num_subqueries": 5
}
```
